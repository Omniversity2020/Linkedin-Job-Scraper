Role Purpose

Working closely with the Country Director, the role will support in shaping our Syria strategy based on the ongoing changes in context and needs, and lead on growing the portfolio. This role will lead on the management and development of British Council Syria programme portfolio, maintain good positioning of the organization within the Syrian context and with various organizations, and expand the scale, scope and inplact of our work on this key regional priority.

For work targeting populations in Syria, the role will have responsibility for all aspects of work across the various funding streams i.e. grant, partnership and client funded; while for work targeting Syrian refugees or host communities (mainly in Jordan and Lebanon, Turkey and/or Northern Iraq) this will be a support/multiplier role working with British Council teams in host countries to develop relevant programming that responds to international priorities and aligns with both host country objectives and our regional Syria response. 

The primary focus of the role is to capture new co-funded or fully-funded business through demonstrating in-house and associated sector strength, and to be accountable for quality assurance of implementation.

Function Overview

The governmental Syrian Arab Army (SAA), the Free Syrian Army (FSA), Kurdish armed groups that are part of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) – including the People's Protection Unit (YPG), Islamic opposition groups, and the Islamic State (IS) are fighting for control of territory throughout Syria. The conflict, which started in March 2011 with political demonstrations against the government and Bashar al-Assad, is now a protracted sectarian conflict affecting the whole region and influenced by international interventions. International stakeholders in the conflict include Russia and Iran supporting the Syrian government, Turkey-backed FSA factions, as well as the international coalition against IS, led by the US. The US also supports ground troops such as the SDF with airstrikes.The conflict has killed more than 500,000 people, including over 200,000 civilians. Civilians have been subject to direct and indiscriminate attacks, including the use of barrel bombs, cluster bombs, and other explosives in populated areas, as well as besiegement and forced displacement since fighting began. Attempts to find a political solution to the conflict have not been successful yet. Two parallel negotiation processes have been conducted: UN-negotiated Geneva talks, and Astana talks guaranteed by Russia, Turkey, and Iran.  
Since the beginning of the conflict, the Syrian economy has been in decline. Total annual GDP has fallen by two-thirds since 2011, foreign currency reserves have been depleted, and international financial and other assets remain frozen due to international sanctions. Inflation has increased dramatically since 2010, surpassing 82% in 2013. Poverty rate has increased significantly with up to 70% of Syrians living in extreme poverty. Unemployment went from 8.5% in 2010 to over 48% in 2015. Sanctions currently in place against Syria include an oil embargo, restrictions on certain investments, a freeze of the assets of the Syrian central bank held in the EU, export restrictions on equipment and technology that might be used for internal repression, as well as on equipment and technology for the monitoring/interception of internet or telephone communications. EU-imposed sanctions were extended until 1 June 2019. The impact of the sanctions is often criticised due to deepening of the humanitarian crisis and complications for aid delivery. 
There are 6.6 million IDPs in Syria, of whom about 80% live in urban areas while the remaining 20% are located in rural areas. More than 5.6 million Syrians are registered as refugees in neighbouring countries, an increase of over 800,000 since the beginning of 2017. The number of displaced people continues to increase but more slowly than in previous years. Rates of internal displacement remain stable, with an average of 7,800 people displaced every day throughout 2017. Forced displacement has been reported many times since the beginning of the crisis. 
6.1 million people, including 5.8 million children and 300,000 teachers and education personnel, need education assistance. Education services continue to be disrupted by violence, displacement, persecution, and lack of access. Needs are most severe in northern and north-eastern and western Syria.  
2.1 million children have been forced out of school due to the conflict, and 1.35 million are at risk of dropping out. Some 180,000 education staff, including teachers, stopped working due to conflict. Remaining personnel are overwhelmed, which affects the quality of teaching.

In Syria, the British Council closed and suspended its operations in its Damascus office in 2012, having been present on the ground since 1943. Nonetheless, we have continued to deliver cultural relations programming in support of displaced Syrians through our neighbouring country offices and also remotely through local partners still operating inside Syria. 

The current Syria Directorate is based in Beirut. It has a mandate to support host country offices to develop multi-country responses to the Syrian crisis, for overall coordination of the regional response to the crisis, and to develop viable long-term models and programmes for delivering impact back inside Syria.

Our vision for Syria is a peaceful and inclusive Syria - where conflict and change is managed in non-violent ways, the displaced feel safe to return, and all citizens have the opportunity to participate in the political, social and economic development of their country. 

We will work towards this vision utilising the cultural resources of the UK to rebuild the social and human capital of Syria through providing knowledge, skills, connections, networks, and platforms 

Our primary focus in the current context is supporting the long-term enablers of peace, security and recovery at the community level: values-based civil society organisations and networks, youth and women community leaders, artists, citizen journalists, social entrepreneurs, teachers and school leaders.

Our key priority areas for the next three years (2021) are:

Increasing spaces for reflection and exploration of UK and Syrian Identity, culture and heritage
Equipping Syrian youth and professionals with skills that enhance their economic opportunities 
Strengthening values-based youth-led community based civil society networks, youth and women to increase local participation in peace processes (through skills and resilience)
[CROSSCUTTING PRIORITY] Influencing, involving and informing UK and international stakeholders on issues related to Syria

The post holder will be based in Beirut (the main hub for British Council Syria Directorate), and he/she will be leading British Council Syria Programmes team (currently one Arts programme manager, one Education & English project manager, and one Society Programme Manager, in addition to project-based consultants). He/She will also be working closely with the Business Support and Risks Manager, regional SBU leads and Levant cluster leads (English for Education Systems Levant Cluster Lead).
  
The post holder will be a member of the Country Leadership Team, accountable for management of programmes portfolio, programmes team leadership, programmes financial planning, income generation (through contracts and partnership funding), evalution through our Results and Evidence Framework (REF) and other tasks as required.

Today, the Global Coalition for Efficient Logistics (GCEL), a Swiss-based public/private partnership, is empowering the true Digital Economy by working together with more than 150 governments, 25 NGOs and some of the world's most prominent finance, insurance and technology firms that have a combined workforce of more than 2.7 million and collectively service 60% of the world's GDP. In summary, our organization has the targets, road map, tools, and the global consensus to empower the Digital Economy.   Following 15 years of patient R&D, pan regional organizations and industry associations have committed to adopt a new paradigm shift by empowering the Digital Economy Platform (DEP) towards building global economic prosperity. Recently, the Digital Economy has been identified to directly or indirectly impact 17 out of 25 2015 Turkey B20 Task Force recommendations to the G20 Leaders.     From a Macro perspective, more than 75% of the world's citizens, through their respective governments, pan-regional organizations and industry associations, have executed MOUs and published regional road maps as the first step towards the deployment of the Digital Economy to connect our world of trade more efficiently.   From a Micro perspective, governments and industry associations representing 85% of the G20 population have executed agreements to conclude the G20 Nations Case Study as a first step to deploy the Digital Economy.  So far, 38% have been completed and the findings are staggering: 78% of trade participants do not have an integrated system and nearly 90% want the proposed Digital Economy.     From a Technology perspective, the world’s top technology firms with 2.4 million manpower servicing 60% of the world’s GDP have executed strategic agreements towards deploying the Digital Economy globally.   GCEL and its global partners have spent many years in preparation and are now ready for worldwide deployment.

The Digital Economy has emerged as a topic of high priority among the custodians of the global economy as they search for a solution to address the urgent economic challenges arising since the last global financial crises. Today, the Global Coalition for Efficient Logistics (GCEL), a Swiss-based public/private partnership, is empowering the true Digital Economy by working together with more than 150 governments, 26 NGOs and some of the world's most prominent finance, insurance and technology firms that have a combined workforce of more than 2.7 million and collectively service 60% of the world's GDP. In summary, our organization has the targets, road map, tools, and the global consensus to empower the Digital Economy. 

Following 15 years of patient R&D, pan regional organizations and industry associations have committed to adopt a new paradigm shift by empowering the Digital Economy Platform (DEP) towards building global economic prosperity. Recently, the Digital Economy has been identified to directly or indirectly impact 17 out of 25 2015 Turkey B20 Task Force recommendations to the G20 Leaders. 

From a Macro perspective, more than 75% of the world's citizens, through their respective governments, pan-regional organizations and industry associations, have executed MOUs and published regional road maps as the first step towards the deployment of the Digital Economy to connect our world of trade more efficiently.

From a Micro perspective, governments and industry associations representing 85% of the G20 population have executed agreements to conclude the G20 Nations Case Study as a first step to deploy the Digital Economy. So far, 45% have been completed and the findings are staggering: 78% of trade participants do not have an integrated system and nearly 90% want the proposed Digital Economy. 

From a Technology perspective, the world’s top technology firms with 2.4 million manpower servicing 60% of the world’s GDP have executed strategic agreements towards deploying the Digital Economy globally. 

GCEL and its global partners have spent many years in preparation and are now ready for worldwide deployment. Our global coalition of organizations involving non-profit, revenue sharing and profit driven organizations is seeking to hire qualified candidates that will play a major role in our mission. 

A passionate and experienced candidate will realize various direct and indirect benefits being part of a global leadership team that is bringing innovation and transformational practices to world trade securing greater prosperity today and for generations to come.

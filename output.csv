The world is more fragile than ever. Food shortages have left millions of people hungry, while violent conflict has sent millions on the run. From poverty and malnutrition to natural disasters and climate change, it’s easy to see a world of insurmountable challenges. Instead, we see an opportunity to create transformative change.
 
We see the world differently.
In crisis, we believe in the power of human potential. In struggle, we believe in the ability of communities to grow stronger.
 
So we act differently.
We understand that communities are the best agents of their own change and local markets are the best engines of long-term recovery. In more than 40 countries, we partner to put bold solutions into action, helping people triumph over adversity and grow stronger from within. For the refugee who dreams of rebuilding her country, for the mother who wants a healthy future for her children — for millions of people filled with the power of possibility —Mercy Corps connects people to the resources they need to build better, stronger lives.
 
We create transformative change.
 
Mercy Corps has responded to nearly every global emergency over the past 20 years.

In April 2012, 32,800 refugees were registered or were awaiting registration by UNHCR. By 2018, the numbers have increased to just under 1 million, making Lebanon the country hosting most refugees per capita in the world. The crisis is not only challenging the country’s existing social and economic infrastructure, it also brings to Lebanon a new set of disparities, cleavages and tensions that threaten to undermine Lebanon’s delicate social and political balance of power., , Various vulnerability assessments confirm that spillover effects from the conflict in Syria are large and far-reaching for Lebanon.

In April 2012, 32,800 refugees were registered or were awaiting registration by UNHCR. By 2018, the numbers have increased to just under 1 million, making Lebanon the country hosting most refugees per capita in the world. The crisis is not only challenging the country’s existing social and economic infrastructure, it also brings to Lebanon a new set of disparities, cleavages and tensions that threaten to undermine Lebanon’s delicate social and political balance of power., , Various vulnerability assessments confirm that spillover effects from the conflict in Syria are large and far-reaching for Lebanon. Entering its eight year, the crisis has had serious implications in multiple areas: a) economic (macroeconomic and fiscal); b) human development and social dimensions (health, education, employment and livelihoods, poverty and safety nets, social cohesion and gender); c) infrastructure (water and sanitation, solid waste management, electricity, transportation)., , In an effort to address the worsening situation and prevent tensions from spilling over, the 2017–2020 Lebanon Crisis Response Plan (LCRP) presents a collective vision to provide for the country’s social, economic, and environmental stability. This plan moves beyond direct humanitarian assistance to develop resilient public institutions that will protect, assist, and deliver services to over 2.2 million vulnerable people., , The Municipal Resilience Programme is a UNDP/UN-Habitat joint initiative intervening in countries affected by the impact of the Syria crisis (Lebanon and Iraq) over a period of 36 months.

In April 2012, 32,800 refugees were registered or were awaiting registration by UNHCR. By 2018, the numbers have increased to just under 1 million, making Lebanon the country hosting most refugees per capita in the world. The crisis is not only challenging the country’s existing social and economic infrastructure, it also brings to Lebanon a new set of disparities, cleavages and tensions that threaten to undermine Lebanon’s delicate social and political balance of power., , Various vulnerability assessments confirm that spillover effects from the conflict in Syria are large and far-reaching for Lebanon. Entering its eight year, the crisis has had serious implications in multiple areas: a) economic (macroeconomic and fiscal); b) human development and social dimensions (health, education, employment and livelihoods, poverty and safety nets, social cohesion and gender); c) infrastructure (water and sanitation, solid waste management, electricity, transportation)., , In an effort to address the worsening situation and prevent tensions from spilling over, the 2017–2020 Lebanon Crisis Response Plan (LCRP) presents a collective vision to provide for the country’s social, economic, and environmental stability. This plan moves beyond direct humanitarian assistance to develop resilient public institutions that will protect, assist, and deliver services to over 2.2 million vulnerable people., , The Municipal Resilience Programme is a UNDP/UN-Habitat joint initiative intervening in countries affected by the impact of the Syria crisis (Lebanon and Iraq) over a period of 36 months.

A solution which is fast, efficient and affordable is desperately needed. 

Recruitment is a constant aggravation. Finding the right person who is seeking work in the right place and at the right time is far from easy. Employers incur large fees for successful placements when using agencies - a less popular option these days with limited budgets. Advertisements are not only costly but can result in a pile of CVs from unsuitable candidates consuming time and money to examine. There is always the hope that a bright job seeker may put their CV through the door at an opportune moment.. 

Within 2 years of launching Spa Staff.com in 2001, Miranda realised something had to change.
